# JadeImplementation
A JADE implementation for two types of agent : reactive agent and stateful reactive agent. In this context, we have a pharmacy which sells drugs as a reactive agent and a patient who wants to buy drugs as a stateful reactive agent 
To access the project, go to the branch master.
